# HWI_demo
This repo contains files to be used at HWI tutorial on July 17. Please see the list of web links (Software_Links.docx) and download and install MEGA 7.0 and UCSF Chimera 1.13 to a laptop you will be using during the tutorial. The fourth tutorial will be a demonstration of our own software for scripting over high performance MD simulations using Amber 18. This software is based in Linux only and requires a computer with a dedicated Nvidia GPU card with a licensed installation of Amber 18.  I will bring a portable gaming console for this demo that you can try out after the tutorial and will discuss how to build one for anyone who is interested.
